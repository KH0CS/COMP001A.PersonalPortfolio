        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h2>Unity 2D Level Maker</h2>
            <p>I started trying to learn level design and creation from Unity. I bought some courses off of GameDev Tv and I am enjoying it a lot! As someone who has never messed with this before it is daunting, but I really really want to make a game in the future.</p>

        <h2>Python Journey</h2>
            <p>My Python journey started about 6 months ago, I wanted to try to learn to code and I decided Python was the one. I started and immediately I was overwhelmed trying to learn too much to fast. I learned a little but I have yet to go back and mess with it. I will again... eventually...</p>

        <h2>Video Editing</h2>
        <p>I haven't really started any other programming projects, but I do enjoy video editing. I took an Adobe Premiere class which taught me how to edit and go in depth with colorization and sound quality. I need to refresh up my skills. I will edit a video soon.</p>
